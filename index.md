### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, I wanted to know how BlackJack worked since gambling was always my favortive thing to do. 
    I learned how to read three words from the command line and print a sandwich order sentence.
    I also learned to check if the user did not type exactly three words and then print the error 
    message so the program does not crash.

Lab 9 
    Lab 9, This lab is my favorite because it makes a real spell checker. I learned how to read 
    words from a file into a vector. I learned how to check if a word is in the dictionary list 
    and if not, it is a spelling error. I also learned to print “spelling errors:” and then print 
    each wrong word on its own line.

Lab 4
    This lab is my favorite because it is clear and practical. I learned how to take one input number
     (milliliters) and convert it into teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces and cups using the given ratios. 
     I also learned how to use cin and cout to ask for input and print one clean output line. Finally 
     I learned how to put each conversion into its own function, which makes the code easier to read and test.
